Exam Structure
Exam Duration
The exam duration is 90 minutes.

Number of Items
The exam consists of 60 questions.

 

Multiple Choice (single answer)
For each multiple-choice question on the exam, there are at least three possible responses. Select the correct response. 


Multiple Select (select all that apply)
There are at least four possible responses for each multiple-select question on the exam. The question will state how many responses should be selected. Select ALL correct responses. Partial credit is not provided.

 

Exam Result
An exam result notification is immediately displayed as a *conditional pass or fail after completing and submitting the exam.  

In addition, an exam result report is available and shows your exam result and the percentage of items in each section you answered correctly. Your exam result is conditional, meaning your results are preliminary and may be updated upon final review.  

*A conditional result means the exam can be audited and reviewed at any time, and the certification may be revoked after investigation if it is found that the ServiceNow Test Security Policies have been violated.    

 Understanding Your Results: 
 
Each question on the exam is worth one point. Your total score is compared to a predetermined cut score - this score is not publicly shared and is not always 70%  - to determine a pass or fail outcome. The section percentages on the exam result notification show how you performed in each domain, but they do not determine your overall result, should not be averaged, and do not indicate expertise. 

If You Pass: 
You will earn the Certified System Administrator certification and receive a Credly digital badge to showcase your achievement. 

To maintain your certification, complete annual maintenance exams (deltas) and pay the yearly Certification Maintenance Program (CMP) fee.
 

If You Do Not Pass: 

Review the exam blueprint and the recommended training before retaking the exam. 
The retake policy requires a waiting period between attempts and payment of the exam fee for each attempt. 
Refer to the Credentialing Program Guide for full retake details.
