Knowledge Management allows users to create, categorize, review, approve, and browse important information in a centralized location that is shared by the entire organization. Knowledge content exists within a Knowledge Base, which is managed by one or more Knowledge Managers. 

With Knowledge Management, each organization can have their own Knowledge Base (KB) with flexible controls over who can see the information and who can help develop its content. Select the left and right arrows below to see real world use cases for Knowledge.
